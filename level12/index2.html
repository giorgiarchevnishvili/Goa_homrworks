    <h1><B>Nissan Skyline - R34</B></h1>
       <h2><i> ninth generation of Nissan Skyline, which is known as the R34, was introduced for the 1998 model year. The R34 was offered in sedan and coupe body styles, and in all wheel drive or rear wheel drive versions. These cars were powered by a range of naturally aspirated or turbocharged inline six engines, ranging from 2.0L to 2.6L in displacement. R34 Skylines were available in a range of variants, with the GT (2.0L I6), 25GT (2.5L I6), and 25GT Turbo (2.5L Turbo I6) being notable examples. The most well known and sought after variant was the R34 GT-R with its 2.6L Twin-Turbo I6. Commonly referred to as "Godzilla," the GT-R was an all wheel drive, high performance variant that featured Nissan's legendary RB26DETT engine. Production of the standard R34 Skyline lasted until 2001, but the GT-R was built until 2002.The ninth generation of Nissan Skyline, which is known as the R34, was introduced for the 1998 model year.
